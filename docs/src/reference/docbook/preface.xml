    Spring Hadoop is a framework extension for writing Hadoop jobs that benefit from the features of Spring, Spring Batch and 
    Spring Integration.  The feature set is limited right now to support for dependency injection in simple Hadoop jobs.  If you have ideas about
    how to improve or extend the scope, please feel free to contribute (see below for instructions).
