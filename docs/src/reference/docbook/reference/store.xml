    <title>Writing and reading data using the Hadoop File System</title>
    
    <para>The Store sub-project of Spring for Apache Hadoop provides abstractions for writing and reading various types of data residing in HDFS. 
    We currently support different files types either via our own store accessors or using the Kite SDK. Currently the store sub-project doesnâ€™t have any xml namespace or javaconfig based configuration as these classes are considered to be a foundational library. However, this may change in future releases.
